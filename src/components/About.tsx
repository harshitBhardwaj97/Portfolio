        <div className="info text-[14px] md:text-xl">
          I started off as a <span className="mark">Quality Engineer</span>{" "}
          Intern in one fast paced Ed-tech startup, got to learn a lot there,
          since I had to wear multiple hats.
          <br />
          <br />
          After that I got an opportunity to work in{" "}
          <span className="mark">CORPORATE on a FINTECH Project</span>, where I
          was assigned as the SPOC for one of the implementations of the core
          product. So I can say that I have an{" "}
          <span className="mark">in-depth exposure</span> to complete{" "}
          <span className="mark">STLC</span> and{" "}
          <span className="mark">SDLC</span> processes, and a good experience in
          working with both small and mid-sized teams. In my last company, I got
          the opportunity to automate a complex workflow of an entire Invoice
          Lifecycle, including multiple steps via SFTP server, which drastically
          reduced the manual efforts of the team, for which I was also{" "}
          <span className="mark">
            acknowledged by VP of engineering with a recognition of my efforts.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          But I wanted to take things a step further and also increase my
          existing knowledge base, so from past few months{" "}
          <span className="mark">
            I have been dedicating my energy towards mastering the craft of
            software development
          </span>
          . I'm looking forward to contribute in the industry and society with
          whatever resources and knowledge I have, and I'm open for an{" "}
          <span className="mark">exciting role</span> that challenges the status
          quo and brings the best out of me !
